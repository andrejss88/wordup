TwinWords API:
    no good, because "associations" can produce "dog" -> "cat", and that's no good

Jackson/Gson:
    Using a mapper is not trivial, because JSON does not have a defined Key structure
        - e.g. if you call for a verb, you will expect multiple keys such as "verb", "auxiliary verb"
        - but if you then define a noun, it will have "noun" as a key, and unmapping will fail
        - To work with this, I'd first need to define Word Superclass, and a class for every part of speech - "Noun", "Verb", "Adjective"

    Somewhat unreliable
